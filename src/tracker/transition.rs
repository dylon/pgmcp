//! The work-item status state machine: an explicit legal-transition matrix
//! with an **actor-capability gate**.
//!
//! `crate::daemon_state::DaemonPhase` enforces only *monotonic* order via
//! `fetch_max`, which cannot express `blocked ↔ in_progress` or
//! `rejected → in_progress`. So the tracker defines its own adjacency matrix
//! as a pure function. [`check_transition`] is the single chokepoint the
//! `set_status` query calls before any `UPDATE work_items SET status`, writing
//! the `work_item_status_history` row in the same transaction.
//!
//! The crux rules that make verification hard to game (see the plan §B/§G):
//!
//! 1. **`→ Verified` is `Gatekeeper`-only**, only from `ClaimedDone`/`Verifying`,
//!    and only with passing evidence. There is **no `Agent` arm into
//!    `Verified` anywhere in the matrix** — an agent cannot self-verify.
//! 2. **`→ Deferred` is `User`-only** and requires a `scope_negotiations`
//!    record. No `Agent` arm — an agent cannot self-defer.
//! 3. **`→ Rejected` is `Gatekeeper`-only** (driven by a failing evidence
//!    row) — an agent cannot mark its own work rejected to dodge
//!    re-verification.
//!
//! Everything an agent legitimately does (groom, start, block, claim done,
//! request verify, re-open) it can; everything that constitutes *judging its
//! own work* it cannot.
